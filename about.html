		<h1>Who am I?</h1>
		<p>By day, I'm a consultant in D.C. focused on data management, privacy and security. By nights and</p>
		<p>weekends, I tap into my creativity through programming. My interests lie in web development</p>
		<p>and UX design with a minimalist lens. With no formal instruction, I've proudly developed my skills</p>
		<p>through self-exploration, persistant trial-and-error and an insatiable curiosity.</p>
		<p>*</p>
		<p>When I'm not working or coding, I can be found testing Bon Appétit recipes, dancing to Spotify</p> 
		<p>playlists or binge watching Bravo "reality" shows. I've also been known to write Spanish-language</p>
		<p>poetry centered around my experience as a first-generation Salvadoran American. My writing can</p>
		<p>be found in <a class="email-alt" href="https://drylandla.org/shop-1">Dryland</a>, <a class="email-alt" href="https://lahorchatazine.bigcartel.com/product/la-horchata-zine-verano">La Horchata Zine</a>
